To further build on that vision, Microsoft recently released a preview of “Monaco”, a new development service specifically designed for building and maintaining Microsoft Azure Websites. With Monaco, Microsoft provides developers with a lightweight, friction free companion to the Visual Studio IDE that is accessible from any device on any platform. It is a rich, browser based, code focused development environment optimized for the Microsoft Azure platform, making it easy to start building and maintaining applications for the cloud. In this session we will walk you through this exciting new Microsoft Azure service, show you how fast you can make changes in Monaco and how the online experience can speed up your development and offers you an even greater set of tools than the ones you already use every day. We will talk about more advanced scenarios, and show you how the extensions work, how you can leverage Git and TFS source control in combination with Monaco, and how you can even make live changes, compile them and have them reflected immediately online.",
